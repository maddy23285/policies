    <h2>Does fernsnseeds.com Share The Information It Receives?</h2>
        <p>
            Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the 
            business of selling it to others. fernsnseeds.com shares customer information only as described 
            below and with Technobee Solutions and the subsidiaries which Technobee Solutions controls and that 
            are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those 
            described in this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
    <uL>
        <li><strong>Third Party Service Providers:</strong>
            We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling 
            orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer 
            lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid 
            listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to 
            personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, 
            they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by 
            applicable law.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
            As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. 
            In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but 
            remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer 
            consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Technobee Solutions or substantially all of its 
            assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

        <li><strong>Protection of fernsnseeds.com and Others:</strong>

            property or safety of fernsnseeds.com, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with 
            other companies, organisations, government or regulatory authorities for fraud protection and credit risk 
            reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing
